# What is Service Broker?

Service Broker provides the user-facing service catalog of items that can be requested and managed by an end user. The end user can view the lifecycle of their deployements and perform day 2 actions, as well as monitor the deployment progress.

The cloud administrator can use Service Broker to manage and present simplified catalog items, customize forms, define which catalog items are available to which users and define policies to manage resource use, deployment lease times, day 2 actions and approval policies.
